# INSA Labs

This repository contains codes and scripts developed during some of the labs I had so far in INSA Centre Val de Loire.  
List of labs uploaded to the repository is not exhaustive, many codes are subject to copyright restrictions (especially for programming projects).  

## Affiliated major

Graduate computer and cyber security engineering degree  
Department of Security and Computer Technologies (STI)  
INSA Centre Val de Loire (French National Institute for Applied Sciences)  

## Repository labs

Labs uploaded to the repository are the following:

### C programming

Some C programming labs the first two weeks of the major, just for some students who didn't code much in C before enrolling in. The teacher wanted to make sure that everyone was in shape before starting the system programming labs.

### System programming 1

Developed in C, these labs were intended to practice different notions seen about Linux-based systems.
Get to better know how an OS works and is developed from a low-level point of view.  
Another class "System programming 2" followed the next semester as an extension to this one. Further notions studied were about threads, shared memory, ...

### Assembly

Assembly labs came all along the module to apply notions presented during the lectures about systems and micro-processors on one hand.
On the other hand, they were also to introduce the last lectures of the module about binary code analysis and reverse engineering.  
The micro-processor architecture adopted is the x86.

### Artificial intelligence

AI exercices were first about some basics (operational research, graph theory ...). But then we went to further exercices about ML such as classification, clusters ...

### Database

Uploaded are just some SQL codes related to the database labs, aiming at mastering different SQL-based DBs aspects. Without having having the original practice document, uploaded codes might seem odd.

### Formal specification

Honestly .... too boring to be described !

### OS Security (one of the most interesting classes)

A rootkit detector and rootkits which hooks the SSDT table and various Windows kernel routines.  
Programs were developed and tested on Windows XP.

### Reverse engineering (pretty cool)

Different labs on RE and memory corruption exploits: BoF, Return to libc, ROP  
Part of computer security introduction class during the 3<exp>rd</exp> grade.

### Advanced networking

Working on Cisco routers based topologies: OSPF, RIP, MPLS, Tunnels, BGP ...

## Hinweis

- Labs are foremost used to practice and consolidate theoretical notions seen in class. They are put in place whenever it's necessary and possible.
However, we usually have stand-alone dedicated projects, completely practical, to apply our courses combining different classes at the same time.
- Projects are the most significant from the practical engineering point of view and for the grading weight.
These projects include a software engineering project (developed in Python3 and using PyQt5 for the GUI), a system and networking project (developed in C using the Socket API) and an application project in Machine Learning.
- Unfortunately, all projects developed within the context of the degree are considered intellectual property of INSA-CVL.
Source codes cannot be published without prior authorization, and only brief descriptions can be provided for.
- The repository is to be updated. More labs and other content is yet to be added ...
